//! Walking [`GitProject`]'s retained snapshot into the heap census.
//!
//! The project is the app's largest single holder of repository-shaped memory
//! and, until this walk existed, none of it was reported: the census reached
//! the commit list only because `GraphView` happens to hold a clone of the same
//! `Arc`, and everything else the project caches — the refs, the working-tree
//! status, the per-worktree status cache — was invisible.
//!
//! Two of these nodes routinely read zero, and that is the point. `commits` and
//! `status` are `Arc`s the views also hold, so whichever path the walk reaches
//! first is charged and the other reports the population with no bytes beside
//! it. A node saying "1,000 commits, counted elsewhere" is the report proving
//! it did not double count; a node missing altogether is the report saying
//! nothing at all.
