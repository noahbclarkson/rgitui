//! Applying and reverting diff content in the working tree.
//!
//! The patch comes from a pair of trees that need not include the working tree
//! at all — a past commit against its parent, a stash entry, or two arbitrary
//! branches — and the result is written to files on disk. A dirty working tree is
//! the normal case: you compare against another revision precisely because you
//! are mid-change.
//!
//! ## Constraints on the two obvious appliers
//!
//! Neither off-the-shelf applier tolerates that dirty working tree:
//!
//! * `repo.apply(.., ApplyLocation::WorkDir, ..)` matches each hunk's context
//!   against the target and fails outright when it does not line up, with no
//!   three-way fallback. An uncommitted edit anywhere inside a hunk's context
//!   window (three lines either side) defeats it.
//! * `git apply --3way` merges into the *index*, and refuses with
//!   `error: <path>: does not match index` whenever the working-tree file differs
//!   from its index entry. On failure it also leaves conflict markers and an
//!   unmerged index entry behind.
//!
//! ## What this module does
//!
//! Reconstructs the two sides and lets libgit2 merge them:
//!
//! * `base`   — the file as it is on the side the patch starts from.
//! * `target` — `base` rewritten with exactly the selected hunk or lines
//!   applied (or reverted). Computed from the diff rather than by matching
//!   context, so it is exact by construction.
//! * `ours`   — the file as it is in the working tree right now.
//!
//! A three-way merge of (base, ours, target) then keeps unrelated local edits
//! and conflicts only where an edit overlaps the selected region. The index is
//! never touched and never has to match the working tree.
